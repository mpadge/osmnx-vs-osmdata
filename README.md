# osmnx-vs-osmdata

Street network showdown between [`osmnx`](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) ->
[`networkx`](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) in python and
[`osmdata`](https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata) ->
[`dodgr`](https://github.com/ATFutures/dodgr) in **R**.

We'll compare the properties of the street networks (the `osmnx`-`osmdata` bit),
and the routing abilities of `networkx` vs `dodgr`... sometime soon ...
